    "This program aims to act as an introduction to qubits, and to show how single qubit operations can be used. Specifically, we'll use them to implement a game. This is a sequel to 'Battleships with partial NOT gates', with which it has some similarities. However, the basic game mechanic and the quantum effects used to implement it will be quite different.\n",

    "In this version of the game, two types of attack will be allowed: Bomb and Torpedo. But some ships can be immune to certain types of attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where it starts getting a bit quantum. Each ship can only be certain about whether or not it is immune to one type of attack. So if it is immune to bombs and you fire a torpedo, it will be random whether your attack succeeds or not. If it fails, the ship become certain that it is immune to torpedos. The effect of a bomb attack will then be random. By switching between attacks, you'll eventually destroy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game mechanic is realized on a quantum computer by using a qubit for each ship. Bomb attacks correspond to Z measurement, and torpedo attacks are X measurements. The outcome zero implies a failed attack (and so the ship is immune) and the outcome 1 implies that the ship has been destroyed. The qubits are initialized in a Y eigenstate, so they start off uncertain of their immunity to both types of attack.\n",
